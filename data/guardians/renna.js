      three at once. Like other satyrs shi also refuses any form of clothing, which given the state of hir big swinging goat balls, it's clear shi's a
      futanari. As a guardian, shi's more likely to try and seduce or have a drinking contest with an invading adventurer, but at least shi's fun to have
      around.`,
