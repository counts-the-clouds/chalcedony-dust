// TODO: Processing for wood. Wood maybe a difficult resource to get initially.
//       I'm thinking that the 'underground forest' might be a feature that
//       gets discovered. We could spawn it when the game starts in one of the
//       outer chunks. (The ring of 12 chunks that surrounds the initial 4
//       chunks.) We could do the same for an underground lake feature and
//       perhaps some ancient ruins.
